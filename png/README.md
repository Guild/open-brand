# Usable PNG images

Include [pixel-fitted](http://dcurt.is/pixel-fitting) PNG images at approximately the following sizes, for each identified major style:

A. 30px wide

B. 40px wide

C. 50px wide

D. 65px wide

E. 200px wide

F. 1664px wide

Include copies of these PNG images with as many colors as necessary. 

## Why? 

Pixel-fitting is a difficult task which requires unusual skills. Non-designers should be discouraged, at all costs, from improperly resizing the brand without performing pixel-fitting. Including usable PNG images will be both convenient and serve to prevent improper resizing of the brand.
