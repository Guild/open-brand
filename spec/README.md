# Brand Specifications

Include a single vectorized specification image (preferably in PSD format) that describes visual requirements needed to recreate the brand properly. Define the size/width/height of the most important visual anchor as X, and specify every other element's size and relationship using values of X. 

Distances of X should be green (#84c82c). Distances of less than X should be red (#e66666). Distances of more than X should be brown (#c8802c).

Do not include any raw software-controlled typography; convert all type to shapes (if including a Photoshop document). 

## Why?

No one should ever attempt to recreate the brand; use this specification document to make it clear that this brand is designed very particularly and its usage should be controlled.
