# Vectorized PSD document

Include a single Photoshop PSD document which contains vector shapes corresponding to every included PNG image size. Also include a vector shape in the PSD that is precisely equivalent to the file in the "spec" folder.

## Why? 

For compatibility reasons, use a PSD document as the primary source for the brand definition. Many non-designers do not have Illustrator or other vector manipulation tools, and the PSD format is widely accepted and used.
