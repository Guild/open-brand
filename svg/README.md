# SVG Vector Image Definitions

Include SVG vector definitions for the brand, logo, and logotype, with a default size equal to the PNG image that corresponds most closely with E in the PSD README file (200px width). 

## Why?

The Scalable Vector Graphics format is an open, universal vector format that integrates well with source control software. It is extensible and widely supported on all platforms. SVG graphics can be used in Illustrator, Photoshop, Gimp, and other common image manipulation software.
